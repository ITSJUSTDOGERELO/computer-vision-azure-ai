## Overview

This project explores the core principles of computer vision, its role in artificial intelligence, and practical implementations using Azure's Computer Vision API. It includes analysis of real-world applications across healthcare, transportation, retail, and agriculture domains.

## Core Concepts

### What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to analyze and understand visual information from the world in a way similar to human visual perception. Modern systems have achieved super-human performance on specific tasks through deep neural network architectures.

### Technical Foundations

**Deep Learning Architectures:**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Superior representation learning compared to hand-crafted features
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: Achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and detection
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining CNN efficiency with Transformer attention mechanisms

**Learning Approaches:**
- Supervised learning using large labeled datasets (ImageNet, COCO)
- Unsupervised pre-training methods (BEiT, MAE)
- Transfer learning for domain-specific applications

### How AI Vision Systems Extract Insights

                     Hierarchical         Segmentation
                     Features             Scene Understanding
```

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Feature Extraction**: Hierarchical learning from edges → patterns → objects
2. **Region Proposal**: Identifying potential object locations
3. **Classification & Refinement**: Categorizing and refining boundaries
4. **Post-Processing**: Eliminating redundant detections

### Implementation Methods

```python
# Example: Azure Computer Vision API call
import requests

endpoint = "https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
subscription_key = "<your-key>"

headers = {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': subscription_key,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

params = {
    'visualFeatures': 'Categories,Description,Objects,Tags'
}

response = requests.post(
    endpoint + "vision/v3.2/analyze",
    headers=headers,
